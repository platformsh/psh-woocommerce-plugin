# Platform.sh API Integration for WooCommerce

Admiral is a *(very) incomplete* reference implementation of a WordPress/WooCommerce plugin using the Platform.sh API for managing a limited-access PaaS shop.

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT! ⚠️  Whilst it is likely that this plugin will receive more love over time, it is not actively maintained, nor is it meant to be. As such, it is not to be considered a regularly maintained product and should not be used in production for any reason. 

The (very few) features of this plugin are:

- Provision new Platform.sh projects upon adding new stock to a suitable product
- Summary of provisioned projects, their status, and orders they are linked to
- Provide end user with a summary of the access details upon order completion
